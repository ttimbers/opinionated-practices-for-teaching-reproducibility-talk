# Data Science:

### *the study, development and practice* 
### *of reproducible and auditable processes* 
### *to obtain insight from data*

---

class: middle

## Reproducible analysis:

#### *reaching the same result given the same input, computational methods and conditions*&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;.

## Transparent analysis,

#### *a readable record of the steps used to carry out the analysis as well as a record of how the analysis methods evolved*.&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;

## Why do we adopt this definition?

We believe that data science work should both bring insight 
and employ reproducible and auditable methods so that
trustworthy results and data products can be created.

Data products can be built via other methods, 
but we lack confidence in how the results or
products were created.

We believe this stems from non-reproducible and
non-auditable analyses:

1. lacking evidence that the results or product could be regenerated given
the same input computational methods, and conditions

2. lacking evidence of the steps taken during creation

3. having an incomplete record of how and why analysis decisions were
made

## Examples of things that can go wrong without reproducible practices

- An interesting result that you cannot recreate 😞

- Your email inbox is full of information related to the project that only you have access too 😫

- A small change to the analysis code requires re-running the entire thing, *and takes hours...* 😧

- Activation time to becoming productive after taking a break from the project is hours to days 😴

- Code that can only be run on one machine, *and you don't know why...* 😵

## *So if reproducibility is so important for data science, why is it hard to teach it?*

---

class: middle

## Possibilities:

1. Lack of awareness of the problem?

2. Reproducibility is an inconvenient means to end, rather than an important skill?

3. Reproducibility does not directly lead to novel insights?

## Key things for teaching reproducibility

### 1. placing extra emphasis on motivation

### 2. guided instruction

## Git is hard!

Command to view the state of the repository 2 commits ago:
```bash
git checkout HEAD~2
```

Output 🤯:
```bash
Note: switching to 'HEAD~2'.

You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.

If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:

  git switch -c &lt;new-branch-name&gt;

Or undo this operation with:

  git switch -

Turn off this advice by setting config variable advice.detachedHead to false

HEAD is now at cea9a00 updated site

```

Dockerfile that adds 3 packages to a [rocker](https://www.rocker-project.org/) 
Docker image:
```Docker
FROM rocker/verse:4.1.1

# install R packages
RUN apt-get update -qq &amp;&amp; install2.r --error \
    --deps TRUE \
    plotly \
    GGally \
    cowplot

```

Build the Dockerfile:
```bash
time docker build .

That took about 5 minutes to build on my Macbook pro!!!

## Examples of how we motivate learning

### 1. Tell stories from the trenches

### 2. Study cases of failures with real world consequences

### 3. Let them fail (in a controlled manner)

---

### Tell stories from the trenches

--

*As a Masters student, I started to use R to do my statistical analysis.
I obtained the results I needed from running my code in the R console 
and copying the results into the word document that was my manuscript.
Six months later we were working on revisions requested by the reviewers 
and I could not remember which version of the code I ran to get my results.
I eventually figured it out through much trial and error, 
but the process was inefficient and very stressful.*

--

*As a Masters student, I spent many hours customizing the colors of a figure
that had many points and lines on it using Adobe Illustrator. 
The next week in a meeting with my supervisor, 
she very correctly pointed out that the color scheme I chose 
would be problematic for color-blind people.
I then had to spend many more hours repeating the same work 
to change the colors of all the lines and points to fix it.
It was very frustrating to repeat such tedious and time consuming work,
and I was not able to meet other deadlines on time because I had to redo this.*

--

*I have one project from my PhD where I am still supposed to help out 
finish some things off but dread doing so because it is unorganized 
and is not tracking the changes in the output with the changes in the code.
So although we are using version control there, the input 
and output are gigabytes of images 
and we didn't set up any good way to keep track of which images 
were analyzed with which version of the code. 
We also "didn't have time" to write tests for the code, 
so there is no guarantee there are not unintended side effects 
from the changes made even if they are tracked in version control.*

Give students a data analysis pipeline project on GitHub, and ask them to run it.
They have done things like this before, but this time, we add several packages 
that they haven't used before. Let them work to install the packages and get the
analysis up and running.

Give them a second data analysis pipeline project on GitHub, and ask them to run it.
This also has several packages they haven't used before, but this time there are 
instructions for running it in a Docker container.

# Why guided instruction?

---

class: center, middle

### *From our experience, reproducibility is not something that most people or students figure out on their own, or if they do, it is not an efficient process...*

---

class: middle

### Excerpt from Roger Peng's blog post on &lt;br&gt; ["The Role of Theory in Data Analysis"](https://simplystatistics.org/posts/2018-12-11-the-role-of-theory-in-data-analysis/):

#### *There is no need for a new data analyst to learn about reproducibility “from experience”. We don’t need to lead a junior data analyst down a months-long winding path of non-reproducible analyses until they are finally bitten by non-reproducibility (and therefore “learn their lesson”). We can just tell them*

#### *"In the past, we’ve found it useful to make our data analyses reproducible. Here’s a workflow to guide you in your own analyses."*

#### *With that one statement, we can “compress” over 20 years of experience.*

---

## Examples of how we use guided instruction

### 1. Pre-lecture activities

### 2. Live demonstration

### 3. Worksheets

### Example: guided instruction

**Course:** DSCI 100 (Introduction to data science)

**Topic:** Version control
]

&lt;img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*n5MnDrinAXeY2NpCX9H8cw.jpeg" width=300&gt;


Students read about version control before attending lectuer.

In lecture there is a live demonstration 
0f how to use the GitHub website to create a repository, and a Git 
GUI to clone the repository as well as push code to the repository on GitHub.

Students then work through a worksheet, that guides them to do the same thing,
which asks them questions along the way about what they are doing at each stage
to reinforce the conceptual aspects of what they are doing.

**Artifacts for this example:**

# Why lots of practice?

---

class: middle

## **Mastery of a subject often involves consolidating ideas, concepts and theories into long-term memory.** 

## **And consolidating most things into long-term memory requires repetition**&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;.

### However, when we teach reproducibility workflows and skills, we want students to do more than learn them, we want them to use and practice them. 

### We want to actually change their habits or behaviours.

---

class: inverse, center, middle

# Habit formation

### *the triggering of behavior from contextual cues*&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;.

&lt;!--In the context of reproducible workflows
these cues are the tasks that students desire to execute, such as saving a file
after adding new content or wanting to share a document with a colleague.--&gt;

and Behavior Change”. en. In: Oxford Research Encyclopedia of Psychology. Oxford University Press. isbn: 978-0-19-023655-7. doi: 10.1093/acrefore/9780190236557.013.129.

## How does habit formation help?

Habits protect individuals from motivational lapses, 
where a desired good behavior is not expressed 
due to a momentary lack of willpower&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;.

- Non-reproducible workflows tend to be "easier" and life gets "busy"...

- Without reproducibility habits, 
its a perfect storm to do the non-reproducible alternative 
**(even when you know it's better!)**

- We want to get students to a point 
where they opt for the reproducible workflow “by default”.

## How are habits formed?

- best learned through frequent, regular, and sustained cue exposure

- some studies have reported that the median is at least around 70 days 
before reaching the plateau phase of habit development&lt;sup&gt;1,2&lt;/sup&gt;.

## Examples of how we embed lots of practice in the data science classroom

### 1. Student practice following live demos

### 2. Lots of low stakes assessments with small/short problems

### 3. Learning technologies &amp; platforms use authentic data science reproducibility tools

class: middle

### Example: lots of practice!!!

**Course:** Almost all Master of Data Science courses (~ 20 courses)

**Topic:** Version control

&lt;img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*n5MnDrinAXeY2NpCX9H8cw.jpeg" width=300&gt;

We use GitHub as our course management system. Homework instructions and 
assignments are distributed to students as GitHub repositories. They have 
to submit their assignment by pushing their work to the GitHub repositories.

We also require that they have 3 commits associated with each homework 
submission.

By the end of the program, they have version controlled their work in &gt; 96 
different repositories!!!

**Tools for using GitHub as a learning management system:**
- [GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/)
- [Classy](https://github.com/ubccpsc/classy)
- [rhomboid](https://github.com/mgelbart/rhomboid)

### Example: lots of practice!!!

## Staging might be useful for practicing more advanced reproducibility workflows

Some reproducibility workflows require some time consuming, 
or complex prerequisite work to have been done before it makes sense to do them.

In such cases. "pre-baking" exercises to a particular point
is helpful for providing practice opportunities.

## Anectodal evidence

- reduced technical debt in UBC Master of Data Science Capstone projects 
as we have gained more experience teaching reproducibility

## Feedback from Alumni

- *"I had my [COMPANY] Git training today for the data engineers/scientists and I wanted to tell you that everything I learned in your class about git was extremely helpful. You did such an amazing job teaching everything we need to know about git and working in technology, (I personally think I learned much more in your class than in my training here in SF)."*

- *"...the use of Git and Docker and the strong focus on reproducibility are of the best technical skills our program offer."*
